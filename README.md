# About

This project contains both Mobile Blazor Bindings code, and Xamarin.Forms XAML. The idea is to show the differences between then when you're doing things like:
* data binding (XAML syntax vs Blazor syntax)
* reusing styles (CSS vs ResourceDictionaries)
* reusing components
* parameters vs dependency properties
* etc.
